- 👋 Hi, I'm @QueueRear
- 👀 I don't want to be restricted in a certain area, and I would be glad if you'd like to share whatever you're interested in with me!
> As for the very interest, it may be machine learning, cyber security and material science, though I may not be that good.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Database, Machine Learning and HTML & CSS.
- 🐵 I'm a C/C++ user, and know a little about Python, Basic and Pascal【which is an ancient language I've learnt in secondary school but has been almost forgotten】.
- 📫 Be free to reach me at [LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/u/queue_rear/) and [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/rear_queue?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343)! Let's have fun together!
